Objective
---------
Write a CircularBuffer module in c and test it.

Requirements
------------
A CircularBuffer is sized during create. It stores integers. If you put to a full
CircularBuffer, it returns false.  If you get from and empty CircularBuffer 
it returns the default value provided during create.  It is FIFO.

Here is a diagram of some of the CircularBuffer states.

Starting point
--------------
You have the CircularBuffer interface in CircularBuffer.h.  You must develop 
to that interface.  The architects said so.  

Instructions
------------
Write CircularBuffer.c.  Once it compiles, test that the CircularBuffer is working.  
Use the provided main.c to exercise your CircularBuffer.  Do not use any unit test 
framework.

Note in main.c that there is a exercise_state variable.  It is initially set to 
writing.  Once you finish writing code, set and are going to start testing, set 
the variable to testing. Once you are satisfied that your code works, set it 
to working. 

Email james@wingman-sw.com when you have completed you CircularBuffer.

Controlling the cyber-dojo test environment
-------------------------------------------
Cyber-dojo does not work so great with IE, so please use another browser.

Compile and run main.c by pressing the 'test' button.  Shortcut key alt-t.
